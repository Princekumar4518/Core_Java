//        Autoboxing -> Converting a primitive data type to an Integer (or they are known as wrapper classes)
//        is called auto-boxing. Whenever you convert a normal integer into a primitive, and primitive ones into
//        the classes, you will get extra functions.





//        Unboxing ->  Whenever you convert a wrapper class into primitive ones,
//        you will lose the extra functionality.


        // Unboxing
        Integer ab=89;
        int a3=ab;   // unboxing  losting all attributes and behaviours
    }
